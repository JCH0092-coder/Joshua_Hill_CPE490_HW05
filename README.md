# MNIST Digit Classifier

To get started, open Git Bash (make sure you start it in the folder that contains your GitHub repository items) and clone the repository by running:  
`git clone https://github.com/JCH0092-coder/Joshua_Hill_CPE490_HW05.git`

Next, change directory to the folder that holds the copied items
`cd Joshua_Hill_CPE490_HW05`  

Make sure the the required dependencies are installed by running:  
`py -m pip install flask onnxruntime numpy pillow`

Once the dependencies are installed, start the application by executing:  
`py app.py`  
The Flask server will start at (http://127.0.0.1:5000). Open your web browser and go to this address to access the web application (make sure to double check that this is the correct url to use).

To test the application, either use the file input to upload a digit image and click the Predict button, or click on one of the sample digit images (digits 0â€“9) to select it (which will clear any previously selected file) and then click the Predict button to classify the image using the ONNX model.

For the colab notebook where i trained the model use the following link:

To update your local repository with the latest update from GitHub, open Git Bash in the project folder and run:  
`git pull origin main`

This project uses several Python modules and packages, including Flask (imported as `from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify, send_from_directory`), ONNX Runtime (imported as `import onnxruntime as ort`), NumPy (imported as `import numpy as np`), Pillow (imported as `from PIL import Image`), io (imported as `import io`), and os (imported as `import os`).
